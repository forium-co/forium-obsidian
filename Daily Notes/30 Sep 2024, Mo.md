# Thoughts & Journal
- Its time to take this seriously.
- Daily 1 hour will do. 
- I think at one point I can do this more than Wokay
- Thread pool will be really interesting considering how much its used everywhere I will use Zig from now on
- This will require me to get a good hold of what threads are and then work on this.
- Will take a 1 hour session to know what's going on here.
- Nice session. Next up is ThreadPool.
- If I can finish http.zig by Oct 7, then I will be free to work on websocket by Oct 15. That will take a lot of my time
- Then I will be working on finish zqlite.zig by Oct 25th.
- This will give me enough leverage to start working on Forium.
- Back-end should be over by 1 month.
- This long project will take a lot of time. 
- So, buckle up. Make the API in such a way that its modular and easy extensible.
- Its possible to be done. Let's do it.
