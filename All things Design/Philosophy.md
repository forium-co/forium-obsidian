- Forium is fast. But more than that, Forium's design should be simple and very intuitive.
- Users should be able to feel the easiness to comment and interact.
- Forium should give the users to customize their website to their liking. Extreme customizability is one of the core features of Forium

## Easiness

The following should be easily changeable:
- Color of each heading
- Color of text
- Font (all texts)
- Background color/image
- Sidebar
- Scrollbar
- Animations

Everything that can be done with CSS variables should be customizable

Every community you visit will have its own design system. Its own color scheme and more

It should be vibrant and cool and glowy and not boring. Every SaaS out there for community is the same boring style. Forium will provide you more than a reason to stick behind.

From Day 1 we will have to focus on design

## Sounds
- We also make the whole website more louder, like subtle sounds that you are played with when you hover or click or enter
- These sounds should create a game like feeling
