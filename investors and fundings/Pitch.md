## Opening Slide

Good morning/afternoon, everyone. I'm here to share our vision for Forium, a next-generation community engagement platform that we believe will transform how organizations build and manage their online communities.

## Executive Summary
We envision Forium as the future of online community platforms. Our goal is to build a solution that will combine three critical elements missing in today's market: AI-driven functionality, true self-hostability, and exceptional performance. We're aiming to create what would happen if Discord met GPT, but purposefully built for professional communities and businesses.

## The Problem
Let me share why we believe this solution is necessary. Today's forum landscape faces four critical challenges:

First, speed. Current platforms, including market leader Discourse, rely on outdated technology stacks. They use heavy frameworks like Ember.js, resulting in sluggish performance that frustrates both users and administrators.

Second, accessibility. The forum space is dominated by closed platforms. Organizations wanting to build communities must choose between Reddit-like public spaces or complex, enterprise-focused solutions.

Third, tooling. Despite the AI revolution, forum moderation and content discovery remain stuck in the past. Moderators spend countless hours on tasks that could be automated, while users struggle with basic search functionality.

Finally, cost structure. Current solutions either lock you into expensive SaaS models or require significant technical expertise to self-host. The market needs a middle ground.

## Our Proposed Solution
This is where our vision for Forium comes in. We're designing a platform that will address each of these challenges:

For performance, we plan to use Actix-web, built in Rust, paired with SolidJS for the frontend. Based on our research and prototypes, this combination should deliver performance up to 10 times faster than existing solutions.

For accessibility, we're designing a platform that will deploy anywhere. Whether using SQLite for a small community or PostgreSQL for enterprise-scale deployments, Forium will adapt to different needs.

For tooling, we plan to integrate AI at every level. Natural language search, automated moderation, and intelligent content discovery will be core features, not afterthoughts.

And for pricing, we're planning a flexible model starting with an open-source core and scaling up through affordable managed hosting options.

## Market Opportunity
The numbers show why this opportunity is compelling. The global online community market is valued at over $1.2 billion and growing. Discourse alone serves over 20 million users, demonstrating the massive demand for these solutions.

We're initially targeting 20% of Discourse's market share, which represents a significant revenue opportunity. With the increasing focus on privacy and data ownership, we're seeing a clear trend of businesses seeking self-hosted solutions.

## Business Model
We've designed our revenue strategy around three pillars:

First, Forium Cloud, our planned managed hosting solution. This will provide a hassle-free experience for organizations that want the benefits of Forium without managing infrastructure.

Second, premium add-ons, including advanced AI features, analytics, and integrations. These high-margin products will enhance the core platform's capabilities.

Third, enterprise support and custom deployments for larger organizations requiring dedicated solutions.

Through this model, we believe we can reach $5 million in annual recurring revenue within three years of launch.

## Competitive Advantage
Our planned technological stack and features will position Forium uniquely in the market:

We're designing for performance first, aiming to significantly outpace both Discourse and NodeBB in response times and user experience.

Our deployment process will be streamlined for simplicity, targeting one-click deployment where competitors require complex setup procedures.

Most importantly, we'll be the first platform to offer truly integrated AI capabilities out of the box. We believe this will be a key differentiator in today's market.

## Development Roadmap
We have a clear execution plan:

In Q2 2025, we aim to launch our open-source core and begin beta testing with select partners who have already expressed interest.

Q3 2025 will focus on launching our managed hosting platform and advanced analytics suite.

By Q4 2025, we plan to establish enterprise partnerships and scale our deployment options.

## Financial Projections
Our financial projections reflect the staged growth we anticipate:
- $250,000 ARR in year one through early adopters who've already shown interest
- $1.2 million ARR in year two as we expand our managed hosting
- $5 million plus ARR in year three through enterprise adoption

We expect to maintain gross margins above 70% through efficient infrastructure and high-margin add-ons.

## Closing
Thank you for your attention. We believe Forium represents a unique opportunity to reshape the community platform space. We're seeking partners who share our vision and want to be part of building the future of online communities.

We're currently in the development planning phase, with key technical decisions made and architecture designed. We're looking for investment to accelerate our development timeline and bring this vision to reality.

I'm happy to take any questions about our plans, technical architecture, or go-to-market strategy.
