Forium should be a place for everyone to experience a feeling of community.

But, Forium in itself doesn't exist. It exists to let people design their life and ideas. Think of it being like Wordpress but for communities & forums.

We are completely whitelabelled and we don't want our name on anything. 

Wordpress has given people access to so many interesting ideas. Blogging in general. People can customize to make it look whatever they want. Forium aims
to do the same.

Forium though is 2025 product. Technology moves fast. Uff! Its primal focus is on its UI rather than the possibility of existence. The browser is the playground.

Discourse and Reddit & Discord even don't allow customization. Discourse is too boring as well. But Discourse hosting is expensive. Somehow the free factor completely gets
removed with them being the only platform to provide a good steady working community platform. And its extremely boring. Its the same text heavy shit all over.

This is where Forium aims to be. It should be made available to self-host and should be extremely cheap even at scale. The biggest communities have a limit of 2 million.
Forium's technology is focused on making it possible for anyone to just handle that without much of an expense. Specially for businesses.

Enough about Forium. 

Somehow its very hard to write your ideas into texts. I need to better that skill.
