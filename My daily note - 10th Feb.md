## Random thoughts & Journalling

Lots! Met Yaseen bhai today. Oh! How much was I missing a mentor in my life. I need advice.
Life is tough. Its important to have a good mentor who selflessly wants your good in all aspects and fields. I need to keep him in my life. He has done a lot of things. Seen a lot of ups and downs. Very humble.

He advised me to never take your personal life for granted. Take care of it. 

Work is just one part of your life. Your family, your wife etc matter a lot. I just didn't have that thought in my mind.
Bewildering! Isn't it?

Lisa's departure is sad. Very sad. But it has brought me clarity.
It has brought me confidence in myself. I had completely forgotten self-care.
Completely ignored it.

I though feel sad for her. It has turned out this way. There were so many mistakes to learn from. Definitely. 

But its time to move forward in life. its time to get yourself the platform you deserve.
I have a clear vision of who I want to be. I cannot be everything all at once.

Oh! Damn. My ADHD is at its again. Jumping from topics to topics.
We will care of that monkey. Don't worry. Step by step.

## Mitul talks

I thought a lot about life. Talked to Mitul <3 about it. Love this guy to pieces. 
Forever grateful to that guy.
He is there. He is smart. And he understands who I am as well. Man!

Him, Ashu, Ritik, Panda. Some people I will 100% be forever thankful for.

Anyway. I didn't work much today. But its fine. I had a good recollection of my 
thought process and put it together. It was just everywhere.

## Aishu - Interstellar talks

Damn! I am going to write this paragraph after I watch it. Need to call Aishwarya again tomorrow. That lady is amaze-balls (mitul's words)!

So so grateful to have met her! Many a times I feel, she is just me, but from different lives.

Well. coming back to the topic. Interstellar. Damn! Aaj toh paap dhulne ja raha hu.
Waited 10 fucking years for this moment.

So, talked to Aishuji. She gets it. She fucking gets it. Nolan is god amidst human beings.

Too excited now. 

## Tushar talks

Again! This guy. This guy has inspired me. If I had a lot of money,
if I have a lot of leverage in life.
I will make sure this guy never suffers at least materialistically.
No creative should ever suffer from worldly problems.

But, until you suffer, you fucking don't realize. he has gone through that journey. He knows!

But man! This meeting was eye-opening. I convinced him to be my consultant.
To be my partner in this journey.

He understands! I have realized I have a high-IQ.
I can actually resonate with this fucker. You need that IQ privilege. lol.
Look at me. Brahmin-ing my way in life. But yeah. humility is non-negotiable. It has to be there. And he is a prime example of that.

Told me about using Elixir over Golang. Opened my brains out as well.

Damn! What a day. People are amazing. I am amazing as well. I guess. Didn't know that.
