This is a blog series where I write something something while writing HTTP Server from scratch.

Blogs:
- Setup, File Structures and `build.zig`
- Exploring the files
- 1st goal: Get a test suite running
- 2nd goal: Get the server just run dummy values
- Tackling `url.zig` and writing a URL parser.
