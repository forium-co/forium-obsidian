Forium will be one of those things that will feature Admin dashboards as well.

While SQLite will be more than enough, Forium's web framework must also give detailed information about the server that it is being run on.

We provide that through an Admin dashboard on stats and logs in the web ui itself for developers who want to see the program running

## Features:
- Analytics on slow requests
- Logs
- SQLite basic view
