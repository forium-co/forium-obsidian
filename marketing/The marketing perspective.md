## Rust is Hard. Zig is easy! Arenas to the win.

- Generally devs don't want to market
- Marketing involves a lot of fancy icons and images and websites
- My first customer for Forium will be Zig-software-foundation
- Community is where the news is

- After the product is built, we can do some GTM stuffs like:
	- Bring all Discord, ziggit.dev, reddit, zig.news, github discussions/issues etc users on the go
	- Have every discussion in a gist
	- Tinder like cards for attracting users to go on and discuss topics
	- Link sharing and discussions. Happen really quickly
	- Chat like interfaces for every discussion. Github issues/discussions but much much faster
	- Tutorials and Documentations all included
- ZSF allows me to independently market Ziglang and therefore I am going to make a show of it. The native desktop app is the all-in-one, ever updating go-to place
  for all Zigsters
- Just open the app and be in peace with people around you.
- Convert conversation to Q & A
- Conversations to podcast episodes (If not expensive. Maybe)
- Q & A will be an important part of why people hang out and its open to SEO and shit. So, you can basically converse in real-time
- Make an independent page for searching Zig packages and all. Every package will have conversation threads and reviews. That is important.
	- It will also show you the dependencies it has, down to the last package
- Users who have signed up, can simply point out their Github Repos and connect the packages. This will increase Zig's reach

### Marketing - Social Media
I also want to try Social Media marketing but unlike the ingenuine ones, I want to try it in a different way.

I want to highlight discussions. As if Hackernews is just alive everywhere. Links from discussions will be posted to Twitter every now and then. The major goal is to
make sure that the reach of Zig is far and wide and tech influencers keep talking,

## Forium as a repo

- If the software I build is a success, then the front-end devs won't hesitate to come and build their apps on the framework I will use.
- Front-end devs are the marketing dudes.
- Give them WebAssembly connecting code to Fermyon and shit. Write better tutorials for the framework.
- Users will automatically float towards you once you make the process of writing web-apps easier for them
- Since, Forium will also have a desktop and mobile story with native components, the whole thing will be a blast.
- So, the excellency of the repo itself is a great news for all the devs.
- We want the users to create their own custom themes. Forium should be customizable to a lot of extent. That is the goal. A default color scheme will be chosen by us
	- which the user can change at any point.
- [Find your Template Â· Wasmer](https://wasmer.io/templates) is the service that you will be collaborating with for the framework that you will build. That's for devs who don't want to spend time on infra and shit and want to get started. That's another marketing gimmick. Cheaper than Vercel, faster than NextJS, more accessible than ShadCN/UI

Speed in total and the whole eco-system will attract every web-dev to get System'y and build apps.

The time for TypeScript to merge with Ziglang is now starting. Zig marketing success will be big for me as it will give me a boost in the dev world.

So, start writing Forium as fast as you can in 1 year. The second year, we are just doing the marketing for everything else.

## Faster AI SDK
- Providing an AI switch is also important.

## Another marketing OSS project
- Zig AI switcher.
- Run inference at the lowest resource locally, Groq, GPT, Cerebras, Claude etc
- This switch and a mobile/desktop app with Zig will boost Zig's popularity
- Its important to note that to become one of the flagship Zig projects alongside:
	- Bun, Tigerbeetle, Ghostty, I have to make sure all users find it extremely easy to create web-apps in Zig
- AI switch as a library is important.

## ZSF sponsorships & popularity
- This popularity will ensure US based customers are also in
- Wokay will be of great impact once this happens
- Zig in Wokay will be used for the service-workers par
