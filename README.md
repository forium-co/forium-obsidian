- Forums should be more accessible to al. Its rather limited to closed platforms like Reddit, Discourse etc.

# Target Groups

The first priority is to improve the visibilty of the platform and thus, we are going to focus on smaller communities. Specially the OSS guys, who believe that self-hosting is the way. These will be our beta testers for the product to be capable enough to be serious.
- Zig Foundation
- Obsidian
- Linux Distros
Make them realize that the product can sustain with 1/3rd of the cost with a forum that has MIT license

This visibility and testing etc can give us a move to approach business and start the revenue. 

This is where we also launch our cloud service to do this for you.
And then its reddit, discord etc. No idea, let's see then.

# Financial Projections

- **Year 1:** $250K ARR – Early adopters & beta users.
- **Year 2:** $1.2M ARR – Growth in **managed hosting & premium features**.
- **Year 3:** $5M+ ARR – **Enterprise clients & large-scale adoption**.
