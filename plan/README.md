# Planning & Deadlines for the whole product

So, first you are going to write RFC and decide how the whole product will look like. Every decision from Landing Page to back-end development will be decided and planned early on.
This will allow me to focus solely on the code part and one project at a time instead of running here and there.

Once the feature set and goals are complete, every feature will then make more sense. I will know what to do before hand and how to handle edge cases that may arrive.

Use Height to plan the whole thing up from scratch.

Don't start anything without planning. Don't leave anything for later. Plan and then work. Plan and then work. This will take time. So have patience.

## Phase 1: RFC
