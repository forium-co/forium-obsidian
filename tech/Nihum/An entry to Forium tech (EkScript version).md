Welcome to the treasure hunt that is Forium. Build your possibilities here.

Forium is going to beat the shit out of Discourse in UI/UX. 10 times cheaper to get a world class experience. Forium Nihum is of the opinion that UI UX going to be fun in a community.

Those pesky Zig community old school dudes are gonna piss the pants if they see how cool programming communities look like.

After all EkScript will the fucking face of peak and power of Zig programming language.

The magic that developers need to build the future of web UI. The community that maxes out performance out of your home devices.

The fastest, most sophisticated performant software programming language that will bring joy to the people write software. Stop writing code, start writing software.

Rust made the system's guys happy. They could explore their imagination into the most performant way possible.

But Rust as a hands of Pythonisque easy programming language for quickly producing something out of thin air is still not there.

And Rust is strict. We need something more faster.

Oh. wait. Did I forget to tell you that EkScript will bring Rust and Zig together as backends to performant friendly code.

What? EkScript will make your Rust code run as if you are moving from a Javascript file to CSS file.

They are in the same environment. No Build Tools hassle.

Performance off the charts. Rust will not reach the scale of EkScript though in the enterprisy environment.

Go is another competitor but man is Golang unsafe and boy its UI story is even more worse.
This is Go's problem, it fucked up its C ABI compatibility. It could interact with all the programming language. Go's problem is that you will be stuck in Go's loop forever.

So, we can beat Go as well, with the fastest Zig-integrated Async loop in a simple way.

Arenas to the rescue.

You can give and take arena's inside your GC based language and memory in and memory out can be specified.
How optimized will it be, imagine. The sweet integration of GC + Arenas.

Go tried arenas but failed. EkScript will not, because these arenas will be all controlled in a tight functional manner.
