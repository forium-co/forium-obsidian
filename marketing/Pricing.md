# Pricing

Tech choices aside, our features are very limited to Discourse. Just make a better Discourse is all we are going to do and that too cheap. Pricing can be of the following:
1. Starter
	1. Free ($0)
	2. 500MB of storage
	3. 50k posts & comments views/month
	4. Custom domain
	5. No integrations
	6. No customization
	7. E-mail, google and twitter logins
2. Standard
	1. $50/mo
	2. 20GB of storage
	3. 500k posts/comments per mo.
	4. Unlimited Staff
	5. Discord and Reddit integration (reddit is pay per use though and may vary)
	6. All other logins (Discord, google, facebook, github, twitter, apple, Microsoft)
	7. Basic AI
	8. RQlite based 3 instances
	9. Addons:
		1. Reddit integration (pay per use). Turn on to sync (might cost a lot)
		2. PostGRES database ($50)
		3. More instances ($20/instance) for faster responses
	10. ...provide almost all enterprise features that discourse provides here.
	11. Custom bots and plugins support (All https://discourse.org/plugins)
	12. SDK (100k/month)
	13. Theme generator (For both dark and light mode)
	14. Custom CSS
	15. Community Support only
3. Enterprise (Contact Us) - ($2000/month)
	1. Everything is unlimited
	2. Postgres based instances per user
	3. Multiple deployments of servers.
	4. Priority Support

Since, I am working on a constraint and the majority of the earnings will be from Standard users, I will have to squeeze the cost for everything.
