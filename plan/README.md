# Planning & Deadlines for the whole product

So, first you are going to write RFC and decide how the whole product will look like. Every decision from Landing Page to back-end development will be decided and planned early on.
This will allow me to focus solely on the code part and one project at a time instead of running here and there.

Once the feature set and goals are complete, every feature will then make more sense. I will know what to do before hand and how to handle edge cases that may arrive.

Use Height to plan the whole thing up from scratch.

Don't start anything without planning. Don't leave anything for later. Plan and then work. Plan and then work. This will take time. So have patience.

# Two parts to Forium

1. The App and the business (Forium)
	1. Golang, React App, Turso, that gets out of the way and let's us develop in peace.
	2. A good mix of SSR and SPA will be required for its success.
	3. Be fast and quick about the app. You are making money here and not engineering orgasm
	4. Some inefficiences can be ignored. Focus on moving fast.
2. The tutorial and the NIH revolution (Nihum)
	1. The engineering orgasm part of the app
	2. You will make everything from scratch and host the app as another forium clone. lol
	3. From scratch means, from scratch using Zig only. DB, Server, File Server, FE Framework, Component library, Tailwind, everything etc.
	4. This is done when you have money. You don't have that luxury yet!

## Phase 1: RFC 
*2 Aug to 25 Aug*
RFC will be one of the most important parts of what makes this product different to others and how it should be functioning. So, make RFC for every single detail. Don't start implementing anything in advance

We take time (23 days) to make sure RFCs are well done and everything.

## Phase 2: Design
*1 Sep to 30 Sep*
Designing will involve choosing a theme, color variant, component library and a good set of everything.

Since, we will mostly be designing on the web as we go on, we will solely focus on the color palette, fonts and other stuffs as we come by.

---

## Phase 2: Front-end
*1 Oct to 30 Nov*
We mock each request with a setTimeout for now and then make sure our front-end is done. Front-end will be a simple Preact App with SSR backed in.

## Phase 3: Back-end
*30 Nov - 31 Dec*
Back-end shouldn't be that hard and we should be able to complete it fast. Plugins might require some time, but that's for later.

## Phase 4: Infra
*1 Jan - 10 Jan*
Deploy using Render and what not quickly. Don't focus much on Infra. We will manage the costs later on.

## Phase 5: Marketing
*10 Feb - Infinity*
Get a course done on Marketing
Get a sales course
Start marketing and writing about it

## Phase 6: Enjoy
