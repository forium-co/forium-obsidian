Forums should be lightweight and fast. Easily self-hosted and easily transferrable like Obsidian. Just get the SQLite file and you are done!

## Self-hosted

- [ ] Forium should be open source
- [ ] Forium should be self-hosted by default without much difficulties. No infra tension. Just start the app on a server and you are done or customize your way to a production app.
- [ ] Proper one-click deploy for those who want to start quick with self-hosting
- [ ] No self-hosted app will be this fast

## Everything is fast in Forium 
- Speed of development
- Speed of page loads
- Large traffic handling
- Zero to self-host in 2 minutes (in a $5 VM) or use Fly.io
